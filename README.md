#### Introduction
This repository contains examples and explanations of various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++, along with a project that simulates a library system. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource for understanding and applying OOP principles in C++.

### Topics Covered
#### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This section includes examples of:

* Compile-time polymorphism (function overloading and operator overloading)
* Runtime polymorphism (virtual functions and abstract classes)

#### C++ Stack
The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides a stack class that is a container adaptor. This section includes:

* Basic stack operations (push, pop, top)
* Implementation details and use cases

#### Const Reference Initialization
Using const references is a common practice in C++ to avoid unnecessary copying of objects. This section covers:

* Initialization of const references
* Benefits and best practices

#### Function Pointers
Function pointers allow functions to be passed as arguments to other functions. This section includes:

* Declaration and initialization of function pointers
* Usage examples and scenarios

#### Function Pointers Using Struct
Combining function pointers with structs can be useful in various scenarios, such as implementing callback mechanisms. This section includes:

* Structs with function pointers
* Example implementations and use cases
